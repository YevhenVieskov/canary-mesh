Write python code for lambda function rollbackto_previous_canary that rollback to previous canary
ChatGPT

Rolling back to a previous canary typically involves updating the ECS service to use the previous task definition. Below is a Python code example for a Lambda function that performs a rollback to the previous canary task definition:

python

import boto3

def rollbackto_previous_canary(event, context):
    # Initialize boto3 clients for ECS
    ecs_client = boto3.client('ecs')
    
    # Retrieve information about the previous canary deployment
    # (This could be passed as part of the event payload or stored elsewhere)
    previous_canary_service_name = event['previous_canary_service_name']
    previous_canary_task_definition = event['previous_canary_task_definition']
    
    try:
        # Update ECS service to use the previous canary task definition
        response = ecs_client.update_service(
            cluster='your-cluster',
            service=previous_canary_service_name,
            taskDefinition=previous_canary_task_definition
        )
        
        # Check if the service update was successful
        if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
            return {
                'statusCode': 200,
                'body': 'Rollback to previous canary task definition successful'
            }
        else:
            return {
                'statusCode': response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'],
                'body': 'Rollback failed'
            }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': f'Error occurred during rollback: {str(e)}'
        }

In this code example, the Lambda function uses the update_service method from the ECS client to update the specified ECS service to use the previous canary task definition. It expects previous_canary_service_name and previous_canary_task_definition to be provided as part of the event payload.

Ensure that you replace 'your-cluster' with the name of your ECS cluster. Also, adjust the error handling and response messages according to your specific requirements. Additionally, make sure that the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to update ECS services.
