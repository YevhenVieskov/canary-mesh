Write python code for lambda function check_deployment_version that check deployment version
ChatGPT

To create a Lambda function that checks the deployment version, you typically need to query some source of truth where the deployment version is stored. This could be an environment variable, a configuration file, or a database record, depending on how your deployment process is structured. Below is a generic example where the Lambda function checks an environment variable for the deployment version:

python

import os

def check_deployment_version(event, context):
    # Retrieve the deployment version from environment variables
    deployment_version = os.environ.get('DEPLOYMENT_VERSION')

    if deployment_version:
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': f'Deployment version: {deployment_version}'
        }
    else:
        return {
            'statusCode': 404,
            'body': 'Deployment version not found'
        }

In this example, the Lambda function retrieves the deployment version from the environment variable DEPLOYMENT_VERSION. If the deployment version is found, it returns a response with status code 200 and the deployment version. If the deployment version is not found, it returns a response with status code 404.

You need to ensure that the environment variable DEPLOYMENT_VERSION is set and updated correctly during your deployment process. Additionally, make sure that the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to retrieve environment variables.
