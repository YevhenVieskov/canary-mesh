Write python code for lambda function update_deployment_version that update deployment version 
ChatGPT

To create a Lambda function that updates the deployment version, you typically need to modify the source of truth where the deployment version is stored. This could involve updating an environment variable, a configuration file, or a database record, depending on your deployment process. Below is a Python code example for a Lambda function that updates the deployment version stored in an environment variable:

python

import os

def update_deployment_version(event, context):
    # Retrieve the new deployment version from the event payload
    new_deployment_version = event['new_deployment_version']

    try:
        # Update the deployment version in the environment variable
        os.environ['DEPLOYMENT_VERSION'] = new_deployment_version

        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': f'Deployment version updated to: {new_deployment_version}'
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': f'Error occurred while updating deployment version: {str(e)}'
        }

In this code example:

    The Lambda function retrieves the new deployment version from the event payload.
    It updates the deployment version stored in the environment variable DEPLOYMENT_VERSION.
    Ensure that new_deployment_version is provided as part of the event payload when invoking the Lambda function.
    Adjust error handling and response messages according to your specific requirements.

Make sure that the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to modify environment variables. Additionally, consider using a more persistent storage mechanism if the deployment version needs to be retained across Lambda function invocations.
