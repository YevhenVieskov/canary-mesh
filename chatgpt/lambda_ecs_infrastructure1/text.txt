write python lambda function that deploy new AWS ECS Infrastructure for blue green deployment
ChatGPT

Creating an AWS ECS Infrastructure for blue-green deployment using a lambda function involves multiple steps beyond what can be handled solely within a lambda function. Lambda functions are generally used for executing short-lived tasks or responding to events rather than orchestrating complex infrastructure deployments. However, I can provide you with an outline of the steps you would typically follow to achieve this using a combination of Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation, and other AWS services:

    Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Write CloudFormation or AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) templates that describe your ECS infrastructure, including clusters, services, task definitions, load balancers, etc.

    Create Blue-Green Deployment Logic: Write Python code (either in a Lambda function or a standalone script) that orchestrates the blue-green deployment process. This would involve tasks like updating ECS task definitions, adjusting load balancer settings, and managing DNS records if necessary.

    Configure Lambda Function: If you choose to use a Lambda function for deployment orchestration, write a Lambda function that triggers the blue-green deployment logic when invoked.

    Set up Triggers: Define triggers for invoking the Lambda function, such as CloudWatch Events, S3 events, or API Gateway endpoints.

Here's a basic example of how you might define a Lambda function for blue-green deployment:
